# Constructors in java

A member function used to initialize an object while creating it. It's the main purpose of the Constructors in Java.

# why we need to difine the default constructor even if it is automatically defined by the compiler ?

okay!, the main reason we define the default constructor in code even it is automatically defined by the compiler is that we can assign any value to the instance variable ourselves.
if we dont define the default constructor, compiler will automatically assign the 0 or the null value to the instace variable that we have declared inside the class name.

# Parameterized constructor

A constructor throught which we can pass one or more parameters is called the parameterized constructor.

---> we can have more than one constructor in a class.

# Copy constructor

whenever we pass object reference to the constructor then it is called the copy constructor.

it's main purpose is that it copies all the contents of one object to another object.

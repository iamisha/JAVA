# How JAVA works

Java is compiled into the bytecode and after that it is interpreted to the machine code
i.e source code -> (compiled) bytecode -> (interpreted) Machine code

# JAVA installation

JDK => Java Development Kit(collection of tools used for developing and running Java programs.)

JRE => Java Runtime Environment(helps in executing programs developed in JAVA)

# basic syntax of JAVA program

package com.company;
public clas Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
//write your code here
System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
}

here in above program,

1. void main is telling that function does not return any value after it is called.
2. static makes it possible for us to run these functions without creating an object of the class.

# Naming Conventions

--> for classes, we use PascalConvention
--> for functions, we use camelCaseConventions

without having to put space inside the function name.

# How JAVA works

Java is compiled into the bytecode and after that it is interpreted to the machine code
i.e source code -> (compiled) bytecode -> (interpreted) Machine code

# JAVA installation

JDK => Java Development Kit(collection of tools used for developing and running Java programs.)

JRE => Java Runtime Environment(helps in executing programs developed in JAVA)

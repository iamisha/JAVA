3. **`ResponseHeader`**

* It helps to print the Httpresponse
* **Example:**
   
       PrintHttpResponse.java

* **Output://**

        Response code:- 200

4. **`HashMap`**

* It is an interface that contain values based on keys.
* Not ordered
* 'Key' should be unique.
* 'Value' can be repeated.
* It implements interface Map.
* It is found in java.util package.

* **Example:-** 
        
        HashMapExam.java

 **output://**

        using put() method to insert the key and value

        {Isha=201710, Priyanka=201725}

        Printing if the specified hashmap contains the following key or not

        true

        false

        true

        false

        key is present in the map

        201710

        get method simply prints the value of the specified key if the key is present otherwise it returns null

        201710

        null

        only for test purpose

        1 2 33 

        1 2 33 

        Printing the key with their values through entrySet()

        Isha

        201710

        Priyanka

        201725

        Printing the key with their values through keySet()

        Isha 201710

        Priyanka 201725

        removing any pair in HashMap

        {Priyanka=201725}

**Qn:-** Write a java program to print all HTTP Request Headers
